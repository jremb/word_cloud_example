# Requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Making use of the database features requires PostgreSQL. In the future, this will also assume that the database has certain tables: tweets, users, followers, and users-followers join table. For those who want to deviate from that structure (column structure will be specified later), they are free to fork or otherwise edit the code the code accordingly.

# Running through terminal:
Windows:
py main.py

Mac:
python3 main.py

# Notes:
The API Query section was put together *very* quickly just as a proof of concept. I will try to flesh it out as I have time. Will also create executable via pyqtdeploy in the coming days. Suggestions or feature requests are welcome (within reason). Please use the discussion forum unless reporting a bug.
