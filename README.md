# Installing requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running through terminal:
python main.py

# Notes:
The API Query section was put together *very* quickly just as a proof of concept. I will try to flesh it out as I have time. Will also create executable via pyqtdeploy in the coming days.
